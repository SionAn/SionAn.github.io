  Hi, my name is Sion An and I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in [MISPL](https://sites.google.com/view/mispl/home) at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) advised by [Professor Sang Hyun Park](https://sites.google.com/view/mispl/members/professor).
  I obtaind my B.S. from DGIST in February 2020. 
  
  My research statement is as follows:
  Few-shot learning is a subset of deep learning algorithms and necessitates only a small set of labeled data. This facilitates the application of AI across diverse fields with limited labeled datasets. A topic of interest is few-shot learning for the development of tailored AI solutions e.g., personalized/targeted tasks.
